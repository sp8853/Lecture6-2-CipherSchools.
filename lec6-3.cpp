"WHILE LOOP"
while(condition)
{
 
int i=1;
while(i<=5)
{
std::cout<<i<<"";
i++;
}

* break statement and why is it important 
suppose run a code untill the user inputs a negative number 
sometimes we dont know when to end the loop without actually running the loop so we have to stop the loop somewhere in the middle , this is where the "break"
statement comes into picture
